# S.O.L.I.D Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
